# Pagination without paging http api includes MVVM, Paging, DataBinding, Hilt
The app aims to demonstrate the power of a new paging library combined with data-binding and superior architecture in android app development.

## Folders-
**Comman**  contains standred error adapters and UI.
**Data** has models, repo and pagingnation logics.
**DI** Hilt dependency injection
**Network** has retrofit request apis.
**UI** has activity, adapters, and UI state for handling data and connection status.
**ViewModels** logics to handle data get from repository.


## How Does it Work?

To give overview here I have a flowchart. ![Flowchart](https://i.postimg.cc/sgX09cLT/Mvvm-1.png)
Here paging source class process pulling data with specific config for paging like page number.

 - PagingSource class for the process of pulling the data,responsible for the source of the paginated data.  
 - LoadParam holds the page number to be loaded,
 - @LoadResult as return type. 
 - @getRefreshKey abstract method for subsequent refresh calls to @PagingSource.load().
